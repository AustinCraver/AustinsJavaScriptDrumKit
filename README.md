# JavaScriptDrumKit
Wes Bos - Challenge 1 of 30

This is a byproduct of my efforts to learn computer programming. 
I was in a rabbit hole when I discovered Wes Bos, a developer that 
has created a number of courses. 

This code is from his JavaScript30 course, day one. I followed along 
and hand-coded the files, then made the slightest of modifications to that code.

Afterwards, I scoured the Internet and listened to way too many samples. 
Eventually, I determined that I could make a better investment of my time 
elsewhere. If I come back to this, I would like to piece together a collection 
of sound files that makeup a decent sounding drumkit.
